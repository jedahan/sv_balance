## sv_balance

Here are some simulations of balance algorithms, made to help [TacticalGamer.com][]'s [Natural Selection 2][] [sv_balance plugin][]. Inspired by [this thread][]

The goals are to minimize the standard deviation of expected team winrate
 (create balanced teams)

And to maximize the expected deviation of who plays on what teams
 (create varied teams)
